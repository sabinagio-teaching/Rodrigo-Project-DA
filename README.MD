# Visit Lisbon TripAdvisor Project

## Introduction:
    - Welcome, this project goal is to create a DataFrame that provides the customer a package with the ideal places to stay, eat in and visit in Lisbon so the client doesn't have to search endlessly for the reviews, best prices and having to think about location wise! This packages will deal with all that.
    - Segments to fetch trough API and analyze from TripAdvisor: "Hotels, Restaurants and Activities"
    - Initially I want to have a few packages available for the customer:
        - 5 Star Package:  Ignores prices and just focuses on best ratings of these 3 segments and gives the customer the best vacation based on TripAdvisor ratings.
        - Budget Package: A budget package that gathers the best ratings combined with the best prices.
        - Luxury Package: A package that combines the most expensive places with the best ratings
