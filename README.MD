# TripAdvisor - TriPackages Project

## Introduction:

    - Welcome!
    This project goal is to analyze TripAdvisor data and create specific packages with the ideal hotels to stay, restaurants to eat in, places to visit and activities to do.
     The client doesn't have think about what his vacations will be like. A well organized package including all the customer wants and needs, will delete the endless search, scroll and filtering options to get what he wants.
    - Segments to fetch trough API and analyze from TripAdvisor: "Hotels, Restaurants and Activities"

    - With this data analyze method we can create endless packages for each customer.

    - To showcase this, we will be analyzing Lisbon tourism data and will create 2 packages:
            - Luxury Package (Focused in price wise and high-end activities);
            - 5 Star Package (Focused in Ratings and Reviews, for customers who want the best of the best, ignoring prices, distances and if its trendy or not.)
    - But there are infinite possibilties with these packages, TripAdvisor can provide TriPackages that focus on cultural tourism (for customers who want to experience the traditional experience), a low budget package (for customers who want to travel on a budget).

    - TriPackages can be created to any town that has tourism activity data.
    - Both packages I created are designated for a 5 night stay, this means 5 hotels, 5 attractions and 10 restaurants for 2 meals a day.
