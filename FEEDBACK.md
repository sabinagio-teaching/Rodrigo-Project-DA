## Round 1

I think you've done things right in terms of project steps and analysis, the only pity is not being able to extract more data. I would keep what you did here as a template for future projects but focus on having more data for more reliable insights going forward. Either way, well done, this is good work!

### Notebook
- I think you hit a sweet spot in terms of organizing your Jupyter notebook and documenting it. You don't have neither too much nor too little detail, so keep doing what you're doing there.
- Happy also about how you split your notebooks, it's nice and clean. Keep this up too.
- `02_rq_df.ipynb` is not a descriptive name. If you check this in 2-3 weeks, you will not know what this was about until you see the notebook. Change to something more specific, like `02_rq_luxury_package.ipynb` or something like this.

### Repo

Name:
- Would avoid schooly names like the one you have now. Should be more HR-oriented, like "lisbon-tourism-packages"

Structure:
- A step-up from before (!) but still needs a bit more work. For example, creating a "Main Folder" doesn't make much of a difference in organizing if it has notebooks, data, and scripts. Try to put these in "data/", "notebooks/" and "src/" folders. If you have issues with importing Python functions or reading data from other folders, just drop me a message.

### README

- I like how you explained your idea! I would just be careful about typos, since they deduct professionalism points. You can use the [Grammarly Chrome extension](https://www.grammarly.com/browser/chrome) to help with that.
